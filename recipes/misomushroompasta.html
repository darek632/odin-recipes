        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g Cashews</li>
            <li>15g Rosemary</li>
            <li>15g Thyme</li>
            <li>100g Rye bread</li>
            <li>100ml White wine</li>
            <li>2tbsp Miso Paste</li>
            <li>1tssp Vegetable bouillon powder</li>
            <li>250g Chestnut mushrooms</li>
            <li>150g Cavolo nero</li>
            <li>3 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>500g Rigatoni</li>
           <li>1 Lemon</li>
            <li>20ml Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pop your cashews in a bowl and cover with cold water. Leave to soak for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>Start by making your breadcrumb topping. Finely chop your rosemary and whizz up your rye bread in a food processor.</li>
            <li>Heat a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add a generous glug of olive oil and let it come up to temperature. Tip in your breadcrumbs and rosemary, then toast for a few minutes until they are crisp and golden. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Drain your cashews from their water, then add to a blender along with 150ml water, the white wine, miso paste and bouillon powder. Blend until you have a very smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Prep your veg. Slice your mushrooms, your cavolo nero and garlic.</li>
            <li>Cook your pasta in boiling, salted water until al dente, then drain. Remember to reserve your pasta water.</li>
            <li>Heat a little olive oil in a large saute pan over a high heat. Add your mushrooms along with a pinch of salt and fry for 5 minutes until they are caramelised and deep in flavour.</li>
            <li>Add your cavolo nero and stir fry for a minute until starting to wilt. Tip in your garlic and thyme, and cook for a minute more.</li>
            <li>Pour your cashew sauce into the pan and bring it to a simmer. Tip in your cooked pasta along with a good splash of pasta water, and give it all a mix until your pasta is coated in a silky sauce. You may need to add more pasta water to get the sauce to the perfect, glossy consistency.</li>
            <li>Add the zest and juice of your lemon and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve up with a sprinkle of your crispy crumbs, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
