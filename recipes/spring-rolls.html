        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Crispy and chewy pork rolls that are perfect for a picnic and a delicious way to use up seasonal watercress!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Rashers streaky smoked bacon</li>
            <li> 1 Red chilli </li>
            <li> 1 Carrot</li>
            <li>200g Watercress</li>
            <li>400g Minced Pork</li>
            <li>5 Cloves</li>
            <li>3cm Ginger</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1tbsp Cornflour</li>
            <li>2tbsp Soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp Fish sauce</li>
            <li>135g Rice paper</li>
            <li>25ml Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Sweet chilli to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the bacon, spring onions, chilli, carrot and watercress. Add this into a bowl along with the minced pork.</li>
            <li>Grate in the garlic and ginger, and mix in eggs, cornflour, soy sauce, fish sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix the filling very well so it is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 230Â°C.</li>
            <li>Fill a bowl with water and dunk the rice paper into the water only for 1 second.</li>
            <li>Put onto your chopping board, after 30 seconds the paper will have hydrated and will be ready to use. If you oversoak then it will become too soft to handle.</li>
            <li>Add two tbsp of the pork filling onto the paper. Wrap up the spring roll, it should stick to itself easily and then put to the side. Continue with the rest of the rolls, be careful not to place them next to each other otherwise they will stick.</li>
            <li>Get a small bowl and fill it with vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Dunk the rolls into the oil and then place them directly onto your baking tray (this helps them get super crispy in the oven without having to deep fry!).</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 mins, turning half way through.</li>
            <li>Place onto your serving plate and serve with sweet chilli sauce.</li>

        </ol>
